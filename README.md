# CSProjDatabase

Still figuring out a better way to upload the database to GitHub. For not the create_db file has all of the commands that are needed to create the database. Simply copy and paste into your MySQL application (I've been using the MySQL Workbench). The loadData_db file has all of the commands to upload data into your database after you have created it. There is also an excel sheet with all of the data that was uploading to the database in an easier to understand format.
