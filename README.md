# CSProjDatabase

Still figuring out a better way to upload the database to GitHub. For now there are a couple of files to help until I figure it out:

These are the commands used to make the database. There's not a good way to have a database on GitHub, so you will have to take the commands and initialize it on your computer. You cana just take the data from the files and copy and paste it into your form of MySQL. Personally I have been using MySQL Workbench to make the stuff easier, but if I need to change something to make it more compatible with everyone's computers let me know!

  create_db: has all of the commands to create the database
  
  loadData_db: has all of the commands to load the fake data into the database


FakeDataLink: A link to an excel sheet that has all of the fake data in an easier to read format for future referral.
