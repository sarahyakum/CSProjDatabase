# CSProjDatabase

These are the commands used to make the database. There's not a good way to have a database on GitHub, so you will have to take the commands and initialize it on your computer. You can just take the data from the files and copy and paste it into your form of MySQL. 

  create.sql: has all of the commands to create the database
  
  load.sql: has all of the commands to load the fake data into the database

  create_views.sql: has all of the commands to create the various views 

  stored_procedures.sql: has all of the commands to load the stored procedures

  FakeDataLink: A link to an excel sheet that has all of the fake data in an easier to read format for future referral.
