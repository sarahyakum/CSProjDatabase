# CSProjDatabase

The database is currently being hosted on personal computers, so it must be initalized correctly. 
1. Download MySQL (We have been working with MySQL Workbench specifically)
2. create.sql - Commands to create the tables for the database
3. create_views.sql = Commands to create the views for the database
4. stored_procedures.sql - Commands to create the stored procedures for the database
5. load.sql - Commands to load in the dake data to populate the database

For the sql files, you can either download them and run them on your computer, or copy and paste the contents into your MySQL editor.


  

Additional Files: 
SQL Folder: 
1. Views_Procedures_Descrip.md - Explains all of the views and the stored procedure that are initialized in create_views.sql and stored_procedures.sql. Including the inputs and outputs for each

Data Folder: 
1. FakeDataLink - A link to an excel sheet with all of the Fake Data that has been loaded into the database broken down in an easier to read format
2. DataDescription.txt - A small description of some of the major patterns in the fake data to help with testing
