# CSProjDatabase

Still figuring out a better way to upload the database to GitHub. For now there are a couple of files to help until I figure it out:

These are the commands, you can copy them and paste them into your MySQL. I've been using MySQL Workbench to do all of it, so let me know if y'all run into issues!
create_db: has all of the commands to create the database
loadData_db: has all of the commands to load the fake data into the database

FakeDataLink: A link to an excel sheet that has all of the fake data in an easier to read format for future referral.
